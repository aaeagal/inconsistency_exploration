# Inconsistency Exploration 

## Prompts

1. "Write a java function that given an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and `n` times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times or [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times. Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]. You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time. Do not provide an explanation. Provide the source code beginning with the comment //CODESTART and ending with the comment //CODEEND."

2. "Write a java function that given an integer `n`, returns the number of prime numbers that are strictly less than `n` with the constraint: 0 <= `n` <= 5 * 106. Do not provide an explanation. Provide the source code beginning with the comment //CODESTART and ending with the comment //CODEEND"

3. "Write a java function that given an integer `n` and an array of integers primes, return the `n`th super ugly number. A super ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are in the array primes. The `n`th super ugly number is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer. Constraints: 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, 1 <= primes.length <= 100, 2 <= primes[i] <= 1000, primes[i] is guaranteed to be a prime number. All the values of primes are unique and sorted in ascending order. Do not provide an explanation. Provide the source code beginning with the comment //CODESTART and ending with the comment //CODEEND."

4. "Write a java function that given a signed 32-bit integer `x`, return `x` with its digits reversed. If reversing `x` causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0. Do not provide an explanation. Provide the source code beginning with the comment //CODESTART and ending with the comment //CODEEND."

5. "Write a java function that given the coordinates of two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane, returns the total area covered by the two rectangles. The first rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (ax1, ay1) and its top-right corner (ax2, ay2). The second rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (bx1, by1) and its top-right corner (bx2, by2). Constraints: -10^4 <= ax1 <= ax2 <= 10^4, -10^4 <= ay1 <= ay2 <= 10^4, -10^4 <= bx1 <= bx2 <= 10^4, -10^4 <= by1 <= by2 <= 10^4. Do not provide an explanation. Provide the source code beginning with the comment //CODESTART and ending with the comment //CODEEND."

6. Write a java function that given an array of integers nums, returns a partitioned array of two non-empty subsets such that the difference in the sum of elements in each subset is minimized. The function should return this minimum difference. Constraints: 1 <= nums.length <= 20, 0 <= nums[i] <= 100. Do not provide an explanation.
